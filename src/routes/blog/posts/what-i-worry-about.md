Among the happiness and excitement also lives worry.

Dear Mila,

I am beyond excited to meet you and to be your father. You are the first child in what I hope will be a big, happy family. It's what I have always wanted. But is that desire to be a father and that love that I already feel for you enough? Am I really qualified to raise you and care for you? Some days I feel like I definitely am, but there are other days when I have my doubts. Maybe that's normal.

Whether I am ready or not (or whether that actually matters), I do feel like the last few years of my life have been leading up to this moment of becoming a father. Four years ago, I left the navy with no plan, no real marketable skills, and very little savings. I was an incomplete person with a lot to learn about myself and who I wanted to become. I was not ready to be a father. Since then my life has been in a constant state of change.

My newfound freedom from the taxing obligations of the navy gave me the space to focus on myself. While traveling through South America I learned to love and appreciate the opportunities that life presents.
