It all happened so fast.

Mila-chan,

With maybe less than two days to go, your mother and I are left wondering where the time went. At the beginning of this nine month journey, when you were smaller than a gummy bear, it felt like we had all the time in the world to prepare for your arrival. We have made slow and steady progress in turning our two bedroom apartment into a home fit for a baby. There's a bassinet for you to snooze in and be swept away into beautiful dreams. There's a changing table where we'll clean up your messes to keep you fresh and clean. There's a play mat (made by your mother) for your tummy time and plenty of books and toys to keep you entertained. There's a boppy and a swing for you to chill in. And there's plenty of tiny outfits to keep you warm and cozy. The only thing missing now is you.

But as the big day (your birthday) approaches, and I become more and more excited, I am also becoming more and more nervous. Do I really know what I am doing? I just recently learned how to take care of myself. Am I really ready to be a dad? I've never watched over a child in my entire life. These questions and many others like them constantly creep through my mind. When I get overwhelmed I try to take a step back and remind myself that I am not alone in this. Thankfully, I have your mother; and she has me. Although we're not perfect and we still have plenty to learn, over the past year we've become a pretty good team. Between the two of us, with the love we have for one another and the love we have for you, I think we'll do just fine. We just have to take things one step at a time.

And the next step is to give birth to you. Even on its own it feels like a massive, daunting step. If it feels massive for me, I can only imagine what it feels like for your mother. All that's expected of me is to be present and supportive in any way possible. That support may come in the form of conversation, encouragement, massages, or really anything your mother might need. What's most important to me is that she feels confident and secure. At the very least I just need to not panic or faint. That's not a huge ask, right? Your mother will be the one doing the heavy lifting. She will be the one to endure all the pain that labor entails. And I am infinitely grateful for her strength and the sacrifices she has made so that we can start a beautiful family.

In writing this letter to you I feel happy, scared, excited, anxious, and emotional. As for when labor finally begins, I have no idea what crazy mix of emotions I might experience. What I do know is that it will be the most important moment that I have experienced in my life. And I know the same is true for your mother. I also know that no matter how nervous or scared we might be, we cannot wait to bring you home and shower you with love. We will see you soon, little Mila-chan.
