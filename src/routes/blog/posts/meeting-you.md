Welcome to the world, Mila. This is the story of your long-awaited birth.

<!-- more -->
Mila-chan,

Your mother and I headed to the hospital last Tuesday evening. In the trunk we had packed enough clothes and snacks for a few days stay, as well as a bag containing the outfit we'd take you home in and a brand new carseat to keep you safe on the way. During the short drive and the hospital check-in process, I mostly felt nervous. I was nervous for you and for your mother and for the induced labor process that was about to begin. There are several different methods for inducing labor, some more invasive than others, and the methods that would be used to bring you out of the womb depended on how well your mother's body responded at each stage of the process. We hoped for the least invasive procedures possible, and most of all we hoped for the safest possible outcome.

In an ideal world, you would have come naturally on your own schedule. Probably some time after April 13th. Instead the induction began on April 6th with the intention to deliver you the next day. Early on in your mother's pregnancy, our doctors decided that you would be induced because you were a little smaller than most babies. Even though you continued to show steady growth with no signs of any health issues, the doctors still felt that induction would be the safest method of delivery. So your mother and I went with the doctors' recommendation and hoped for the best.

As you know, since you are reading this, everything turned out perfectly fine. I won't bore you with all the details, but after about 20 hours in hospital, most of which was spent watching tv shows and listening to music, the doctor manually broke your mother's water. From there things started moving very quickly. Up to that point your mother had somehow easily endured the pains of pregnancy, but now the pain was becoming increasingly intense. Before anyone really expected it, I was frantically calling the nurse back to the room and we were getting set for your birth. Just a few minutes later at 7:07 p.m. you had arrived and were placed right into your mother's arms.

With your mother still in a state of shock from the intense pain she had just endured, my eyes welled up with tears. I have trouble putting into words the feeling that came over me when I first laid my eyes on you; an overwhelming feeling of love, mixed with a deep sense of relief, and a recognition of the gravity of the moment. In an instant everything had changed. We were a family now. Over the next hour your mother showered you with love and warmth as you lay sleepily in her arms.

After an hour of skin-to-skin with your mother the nurses took you off to the side to take some measurements and give you your first round of shots. All vital signs were good and you measured 17.75 inches tall and weighed 5lbs 4.8oz. After some time, the nurses cleaned up the room, turned down the lights, and quietly left the room. Finally it was just the three of us together. Just as it had been the last nine months at home, except that now, instead of resting in your mother's belly, you were lying in our arms. We felt so grateful that you had arrived perfectly healthy and so very beautiful.

Over the next couple days, with the help of the hospital nursing staff, we learned how to manage the day-to-day tasks of taking care of a baby. Besides the physical and emotional difficulties involved with breastfeeding, caring for a newborn is surprisingly simple. It boils down to a few things: wake you up, feed you, change your diaper, swaddle you, and occasionally calm you down when you get fussy, which thankfully hasn't been very often. Although I felt like we had a handle on things after the first sleepless night with you, we were required to endure an additional day of uncomfortable sleep and awful hospital food in order for the doctor to verify that you and your mother remained healthy and stable.

After lunchtime on Friday, April 9th, we were finally allowed to bring you home. We put a fresh diaper on you, dressed you in a cute outfit, and strapped you in your carseat for the first time. As I drove away from the hospital with you and your mother together in the backseat, I didn't feel scared at all. I felt excited to start this new adventure and grateful to be in the company of the two people I love the most.
