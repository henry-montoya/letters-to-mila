The first of many letters to you.

<!-- more -->
Mila-chan,

After 34 weeks, it has finally sunk in that you are coming. A couple days ago I got to see you for the first time during your ultrasound. Before that I wasn't able to go with your mother because of a virus that's been making its way around the world and making a lot people very worried in the process. Thankfully some things are calming down now and I got to take my first peek at you squiriming around in your mother's belly. It probably felt like just another day for you, stretching your legs and practicing your breathing, but to me it was nothing short of amazing. 

Let me take you back a ways, not so far back as to overwhelm you, just about a year ago when your mother and I reunited in Colorado. I can't remember everything in great detail as it was all kind of a whirlwind, but I think I can give you a rough timeline of 
events...

Back in March of 2020 your mother crossed the Pacific Ocean on a flight from Japan. She's from Japan and so are you in many ways, but more on that some other time. Her final destination was Colorado. She left behind a comfortable life in Yokohama so that we could finally be together. The adjustment was difficult to say the least. The sacrifices on my end were minimal. It mostly involved a mindset shift from prioritizing my own needs and time to prioritizing *our* needs and *our* time. For your mother the changes and the sacrifices were significant. She left behind family, friends, a career, and the comforts of home for a cold, unknown, locked-down Colorado. 

We spent the first couple months adjusting to our new reality and learning how to live together in harmony. On the last day of April, when I felt like the dust had finally settled from the transition to a new life together, I decided it was time to take the next step. That morning your mother and I rose early to catch the sunrise at Red Rocks, took a walk at the foot of the flatirons, and retured home where I got down on one knee, and asked her to marry me. Thankfully, she said yes, and less than two weeks later on May 12th we were officially husband and wife.

We spent the next few months enjoying the beautiful Colorado mountains and sunshine. We made trips to Rocky Mountain National Park, spent a week in Telluride, paddleboarded at Twin Lakes, visited Great Sand Dunes National Park, and explored a bunch of other spots. Don't worry. We'll revisit all those places after you arrive.

In August, as the summer was coming to an end, your mother shared with me a little news, which may have been the best news I have ever received. She had just found out that she was pregnant, and that you'd be joining us in less than a year. We were extremely excited and we still are. Over the next few months, while you were growing little by little every day, your mother and I worked during the day, watched TV together at night, and took trips on the weekends. In our day to day lives things were mostly the same, but we were living with a whole new purpose.

In the beginning it was pretty easy to stay calm. It seemed like there was so much time to prepare. We told our families and friends, started taking classes online, read the books, and slowly accumulated all the necessary baby things. Now all that time we thought we had, has passed in an instant. On paper, we've done all the things we're supposed to do in order to be *ready*. And maybe we are ready, or maybe it's impossible to be ready. It's easy to question yourself when you're only weeks away from the most important, most transformative event of your life.

I may not know much about being a father yet, but I promise that loving you and loving your mother is the primary focus of my life. I am beyond excited to meet you, to hold you, and to teach you about the world. In the meantime, continue to grow big and strong and remember that you are so loved.
