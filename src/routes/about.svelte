  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    Letters to Mila is a collection of letters from me to you, Mila-chan. It's a
    place where I can share my thoughts with you while you're still learning to
    understand. My hope is that one day these letters will provide you with a
    glimpse into your earliest days, and insight into the ups and downs,
    struggles and triumphs of your mother and I as we figure out how to be
    parents.
